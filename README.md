Our team's capstone project in data science represents a culmination of our efforts in exploring complex datasets to uncover insights related to trend buying and fashion pattern recognition. Divided into two distinct components, our project delves into the analysis of consumer behavior and market trends.

We initiated the project by rigorously pre-processing the data, which involved tasks such as data splitting, manipulation, and cleaning. This phase ensured the integrity and reliability of our dataset, laying a solid groundwork for subsequent analyses.

Subsequently, we conducted comprehensive data analysis, employing a variety of visualization techniques such as bar graphs, timeline graphs, and pie charts. These visualizations served as effective tools in presenting trends and patterns in an intuitive manner, facilitating deeper insights into consumer preferences and market dynamics.

A key aspect of our project was the utilization of the PrefixSpan algorithm for pattern recognition. This algorithm enabled us to identify frequent patterns within our extensive datasets, offering valuable insights into trends in trend buying and fashion preferences.

Our project underscores the significance of data science methodologies in driving actionable insights and informing strategic decision-making in business contexts. As we conclude this project, we are excited to apply our learnings to future endeavors and contribute to the evolving landscape of data science.
